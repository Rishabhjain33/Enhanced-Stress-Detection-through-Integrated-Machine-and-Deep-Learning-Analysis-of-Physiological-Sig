# Enhanced Stress Detection through Integrated Machine and Deep Learning Analysis of Physiological Signals

Abstract— The prevalence of stress-related disorders underscores the need for advanced detection methods that are both reliable and nuanced. This study pioneers a multifaceted approach by harnessing the combined power of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to analyze physiological signals for stress detection. Utilizing the PhysioNet Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers (SRA) database, we embarked on a rigorous process of signal pre-processing, feature extraction, and selection to isolate the most indicative markers of stress. Our results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Naïve Bayes, surpassing all other traditional ML models, with accuracies of 98% and 88.24% achieved in classifying stress into two levels and three levels, respectively. Among the DL models, the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model achieved remarkable accuracies of 99.09% and 90% in binary and multi-level stress classification, respectively. This research marks a significant advancement in stress detection technologies, offering a comprehensive framework for future developments in mental health diagnostics.
